# Python Visualization with Matplotlib

This project demonstrates key data visualization techniques in Python using `matplotlib.pyplot`. It was completed as part of a course module to practice plotting and presenting data clearly.

## üîç Project Overview

The notebook (`pyplot.ipynb`) includes solutions to four visualization tasks:

### Question 1
A horizontal bar plot showing the frequency of each character in a large block of text using `Counter()` from the `collections` module.

### Question 2
A set of randomly generated integers visualized using both `scatter()` and `plot()` on separate axes.

### Question 3
The same data as Question 2, but with different styles and colors applied to the scatter and line plots.

### Question 4
A comparison plot of insertion sort vs. merge sort execution times for various input sizes, with a legend to distinguish between them.
